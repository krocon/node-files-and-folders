# files-and-folders (FnF)
Become a master of file management with **"Files and Folders"** (FnF). FnF is an orthodox browser based file manager for *Mac OS X*, *Windows* and *Linux*.

The server component based on *Node.js*, the client component on *AngularJS*.

It's an early version! Tested on Windows 7 and Mac OS X. Documentation will be expanded and new features will be added.

## Note
This software serves me as a sandbox to try out new technologies like [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/WebSockets), [css custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_variables) and so on. Therefore, the use of the latest browser is required (see [caniuse](http://caniuse.com/#search=css%20variables)).


## Installation

Create an empty folder. Open your shell (console) and navigate to this folder. Enter:
> npm i files-and-folders

A directory named *node_modules* is created with some sub folders. Navigate to *node_modules/files-and-folders* Enter:
> cd node_modules/files-and-folders

Start app with:  
> node demo.app.js

In case of an error have a look at *clientRoot: __dirname + '/../files-and-folders-client/release'*.

### Usage

Edit and call the demo app:
```js
(function () {

  "use strict";

  var fnf = require('files-and-folders-server');
  var open = require('open');

  var port = 3002;

  console.info('app / __dirname :', __dirname);
  fnf.start({
    // auth: require('./demo.auth.js'), // optional
    clientRoot: __dirname + '/node_modules/files-and-folders-client/release',
    port: port
  });

  var url = 'http://localhost:' + port + '/';
  open(url);

})();
```
You can set an auth module, see demo.auth.js.

### Customizing



#### User definable colors: <a name="colors"></a>

A color customizing dialog will be added. At the moment you can change an existing color scheme (or add a new one) by editing the json files in the folder *./node_modules/files-and-folders-server/config/color/*.
In browser click on the last button (pencil icon) to open the color menu and select a color scheme. The colors changes immediately. This state will be saved (see *./node_modules/files-and-folders-server/temp/*). This means, after page reload you will get the last (saved) state.

The user can create new color schemes with real time preview:

The user can choose between three predefined color schemes:

Light:

#### User definable keyboard shortcuts: <a name="shortcuts"></a>
Speed up your workflow by relying less on the mouse. Create a custom list of keyboard shortcuts using various action keys.

A keyboard shortcut customizing dialog will be added. At the moment you can change the shortcuts by editing the json files in the folder *./node_modules/files-and-folders-server/config/shortcut/*. There is a file with one of these names: *osx.json*, *windows.json* and *linux.json*. The used file depends on your operating system.

In these json files you can map a shortcut with an action id. You can add more than one shortcut to an action id. The action ids should be self explained. Shortcuts are expained here: [Keypress](https://dmauro.github.io/Keypress/) by David Mauro.
